I (The developer) am the composer of this track. In non-virtual life, it is actually called "Universe is Vibration" and I've composed it to the band I've used be the keyboardist of. None of them cared pretty much about my compositions, so it ended up here... SNAKE MID.

If for some reason you've enjoyed it, check out my youtube channel as a composer: youtube/user/poisonewein

Poisone Wein is my personal musical project, and feel free to google it (Soundcloud, bandcamp, whatever).

Also, feel free to use my mid if you wish, but I'd enjoy some notification: poisonewein@gmail.com / ericsonwrp@gmail.com.
