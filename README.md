Ergame
======

An open-source object-oriented engine-library for game development in Python with Pygame.

The engine is over constant development, and the only official file of it is ergame.py (So you can just download and use it without bothering with the rest).

Check out the Ergame wiki I'm writing in order to learn how to use it.
