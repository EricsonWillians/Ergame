Ergame
======
An open-source object-oriented engine for game development with Python 2.7 and Pygame. Ergame's aim is to make life easier where Pygame's not so obvious (Input, for example), and to provide several objects that are useful for game development, as well as a whole system that makes scene management more coherent.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/EricsonWillians/Ergame/wiki) I'm writing in order to understand it better.
