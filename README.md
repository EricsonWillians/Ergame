Ergame
======
The encapsulated and object-oriented solution for Game Development with Python.

* Ergame is an open-source object-oriented engine for game development with [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) (You only need to have these installed).

Ergame provides classes and functions that make game development more objective and easy, and it also provides its own graphical user interface: Ergui. Check out the WIKI. The engine will be updated constantly, so, keep an eye out and watch it.
